# knob

A rotary encoder with a push button on an ESP32-S3.

- **Turn:** pick an agent.
- **Press:** open its prompt (on an agent without a prompt: focus its terminal).
- In a prompt, **turn** to pick an option (`*` marks the primary one) and **press** to answer;
  a **long press** goes back.

Deck Link uses the S3's native USB port. What the knob points at is printed as text on the UART port
(`Serial0`, the DevKitC-1's "UART" USB connector), so the Deck Link port carries frames only. Build the
`-oled` environment to show it on an SSD1306 as well.

It subscribes to `FIELDS_TILE | FIELDS_PROMPT`. Answering and focusing need scope **act**:

```sh
agentctl devices approve knob-<id>
agentctl devices scope knob-<id> act
```

## Parts and wiring

- ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
- a quadrature rotary encoder with push button (e.g. EC11 / KY-040)
- optional: SSD1306 128×64 OLED, I²C, address 0x3C

| encoder | ESP32-S3 |
|---|---|
| A (CLK) | GPIO4 |
| B (DT) | GPIO5 |
| switch (SW) | GPIO6 |
| C / GND, other switch pin | GND |

Internal pull-ups are used; a KY-040 module's own pull-ups are fine too. Override pins with
`-DENC_A=… -DENC_B=… -DENC_BUTTON=…`, and `-DENC_STEPS=2` for encoders with two steps per detent.
OLED: SDA GPIO8, SCL GPIO9, VCC 3V3, GND.

## Build and flash

```sh
pio run -d firmware/deck-link/examples/knob                      # text view on Serial0
pio run -d firmware/deck-link/examples/knob -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1-oled
pio run -d firmware/deck-link/examples/knob -t upload
agentctl link add <the native USB port>
```
